# Coding your own Discord bot


## Creating the Bot
- Make a Discord account, then click [this link](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me)
- From this area, start a new app
- Name it something short and memorable, add a description if you like 
- Check the "Create a Bot User" box

## Adding it to your server
-  You'll need to be in a server that you own, or where you have admin permissions.
- Under "App Details", copy the Client ID
- On the left sidebar, scroll down to Topics, select OAuth2
- Open the Bots page, copy the URL example
- Paste the URL somewhere, and replace the number with your Client ID
- Paste this new URL into your browser, and add the bot to whichever server you want

## Pick a language
For this tutorial I chose JavaScript, because that's where I have the most experience. After you pick a language to code your bot in, download the appropriate compiler/editor. 
I recommend [this one](https://nodejs.org/en/) for fellow JavaScript users.
